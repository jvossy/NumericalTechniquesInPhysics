Accepts: 
A is a square matrix in the equation Ax=b
b is a column vector (inhomogeneity) in the equation Ax=b
w is the relaxation factor
tol is the tolerance, defined as |xold â€“ xnew| < tol. The tolerance is considered to be reached only when
every element of x is within tol of the previous iteration
Returns
(runs,x) is a tuple, where
runs is an integer, representing the number of iterations used to reach the tolerance
x is the vector (float) that solves the equation Ax=b using the Jacobi method with relaxation. As a starting
guess for the solution, use a vector with components given by [x0]i = bi /Ai,i.
